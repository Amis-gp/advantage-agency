How to cloak links? If you're running gambling or crypto campaigns on Facebook, Google, or TikTok, you need to cloak your links to avoid account bans. This step-by-step guide will show you exactly how to do it.

Link cloaking shows different content to different visitors. Platform moderators see a safe "white" page that complies with policies. Real users see your actual offer—casino, crypto, or another restricted niche.

In this practical guide, you'll learn how to cloak links step-by-step, set up white pages, configure IP filtering, and protect your campaigns.

## Why You Need to Cloak Links

Platforms like Facebook, Google, and TikTok ban gambling, crypto, and other restricted offers. Without cloaking, your campaigns face account bans, creative rejections, and scaling limitations.

Cloaking extends campaign lifespan by 3-5 times on average. When someone clicks your ad:
1. **System checks** - The cloaker analyzes IP address, User-Agent, and traffic source
2. **Decision made** - If it's a platform bot (moderator), show white page. If it's a real user, show your offer
3. **Content served** - The appropriate page loads instantly

## How to Cloak Links: Step-by-Step Guide

### Step 1: Choose Your Cloaking Tool

**Option A: PWA Service (Easiest)**
* Built-in cloaking and white page generator
* Setup takes 5-10 minutes
* Examples: Palladium, Cloakerly, NoIP

**Option B: Tracker (Advanced)**
* Full control over routing rules
* Examples: Keitaro, Voluum, Binom

**Recommendation:** Start with a PWA service if you're new to cloaking.

### Step 2: Create Your White Page

Your white page is what platform moderators see. It must:
* Be 100% compliant - No gambling, crypto, or restricted keywords
* Look professional - Legitimate design, fast loading
* Be mobile-friendly - Most traffic is mobile

**Pro tip:** Use a white page generator from your PWA service.

### Step 3: Set Up IP Filtering

Block moderator IPs and User-Agents:
* **Facebook:** Block "facebookexternalhit", "Facebot" + 30k+ Meta IPs
* **Google:** Block "Googlebot" + Google Ads IP ranges
* **TikTok:** Block TikTok crawler User-Agents + moderation IPs

**How to do it:**
1. Go to IP filtering settings in your cloaking tool
2. Upload moderator IP database
3. Add User-Agent rules
4. Save and activate

### Step 4: Configure Your Links

1. Enter your real offer URL (casino/crypto landing page)
2. Enter your white page URL (compliant page for moderators)
3. Set routing rules (moderators → white page, real users → offer)
4. Generate cloaked link

### Step 5: Test Your Cloaked Link

Before launching:
1. Test from your device - You should see your real offer
2. Test from platform debugger - Should show white page
3. Test mobile and desktop versions
4. Test from different IPs if possible

## Common Mistakes When Cloaking Links

**Mistake 1: Using Outdated IP Databases**
* Update your IP database monthly. Moderator IPs change regularly.

**Mistake 2: Poor White Page Quality**
* Invest in professional white pages. They must look legitimate and load fast.

**Mistake 3: Not Testing Properly**
* Always test from multiple devices and IPs before launching.

**Mistake 4: Using Same White Page for All Campaigns**
* Rotate between 3-5 different white pages to avoid patterns.

## What Cloaking Can't Protect You From

Even perfect link cloaking won't save you from user complaints, traffic anomalies, poor creatives, or bad landing pages.

**Success formula:** Cloaking + quality creatives + optimized landing pages + proper tracking + smart scaling.

## Best Practices for Link Cloaking in 2025

1. **Update IP databases monthly** - Moderator IPs change regularly
2. **Invest in quality white pages** - They must look legitimate and load fast
3. **Rotate white pages** - Use 3-5 different white pages to avoid patterns
4. **Test before launching** - Always test from multiple devices and IPs
5. **Don't scale too fast** - Gradual scaling looks more natural
6. **Monitor traffic patterns** - Unusual spikes can trigger detection

## Platform-Specific Settings

**Facebook:**
* Block User-Agent: "facebookexternalhit", "Facebot"
* Block IPs from Ireland and USA
* Test with Facebook's link debugger

**Google:**
* Block User-Agent: "Googlebot"
* Monitor Google Ads IP ranges
* Test with Google's mobile-friendly test

**TikTok:**
* Block TikTok crawler User-Agents
* White page must be mobile-optimized
* Test on actual TikTok devices

## Quick Start: Cloak Your First Link Today

1. Sign up for a PWA service (Palladium, Cloakerly, or similar)
2. Create a white page using their generator
3. Upload moderator IP database (30k+ IPs)
4. Configure your links (real offer URL + white page URL)
5. Test thoroughly with platform debuggers and real devices
6. Launch with small budgets, scale gradually

**Time required:** 10-15 minutes for setup, 30 minutes for testing.

## Conclusion

Link cloaking is essential for running gambling and crypto campaigns. It's not magic, but it can extend campaign lifespan by 3-5 times when done correctly.

**Use cloaking if:** You're promoting restricted offers, have quality white pages and IP databases, and understand the risks.

**Don't use cloaking if:** You're running compliant offers or can't maintain IP databases and white pages.
