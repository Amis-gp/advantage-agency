            I come from humble beginnings â€” the oldest of four kids in a Ukrainian village, where hard work wasn't a choice, it was survival. With no safety nets, I took on the <span className="text-red-600 font-bold">responsibility of supporting my family</span> and working toward retiring my parents.
          </p>
          <p>
            I moved to Poland to study, while grinding through low-paying, physical jobs â€” kitchens, McDonald's, construction, supermarkets â€” whatever kept the lights on. At one point, I was <span className="font-bold">juggling two jobs and university</span>, living a disciplined, ascetic life focused on growth, learning, and <span className="text-red-600 font-bold">breaking the cycle</span>. ðŸ“š

            My break came when I landed a role at Google â€” <span className="text-red-600 font-bold">beating out over 50 candidates</span>. I'll share the full story on YouTube one day, but it started with pure hunger and zero excuses.
          </p>
          <p>
            Soon, I was presenting to crowds of 200+, winning company-wide pitch competitions in front of the top Googlers from Dublin. I <span className="font-bold">won twice out of two appearances</span> â€” and earned a reputation as one of the top performers in the office.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the time, â‚¬1,500/month felt like a fortune, especially in Poland, where the average was â‚¬700. But it still wasn't freedom. I lived in a cramped apartment with six others, didn't eat out, didn't buy clothes â€” just <span className="text-red-600 font-bold">saved like a machine</span>. I managed to put away â‚¬10,000 in seven months at age 21.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then I lost all of it â€” testing 10 e-commerce projects that flopped. That pain taught me more than any win ever could. As a foreigner in Poland, I faced discrimination and exclusion. No one rolled out a red carpet. But that only made me <span className="font-bold">more determined to carve my own path</span> â€” by any means necessary.

          <p>
            After Google, I went all-in on freelancing â€” running Google Ads, building websites, and helping small businesses go digital. It was just me, grinding <span className="text-red-600 font-bold">9 AM to 9 PM, every day</span>. No team, no safety net â€” just hustle and referrals.
          </p>
          <p>
            Six months in, I hit a wall. Freelancing wasn't stable, and the income (â‚¬1.5kâ€“â‚¬2k/month) wasn't enough for the life I wanted. So I made a move â€” rented a shared flat, and spent an entire month doing nothing but job interviews. <span className="font-bold">27 of them</span>, to be exact.
          </p>
          <p>
            The result? I landed <span className="text-red-600 font-bold">two high-pressure corporate roles at once</span> â€” Voluum and BenefitHub â€” both in SaaS sales. You can verify that on my <Link href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/stepan-potichnyi/" target="_blank" className="text-blue-500 font-bold">LinkedIn profile</Link>. For nearly three years, I carried the revenue of two tech companies on my back. No weekends. No balance. Just pure output. My income jumped to â‚¬3kâ€“â‚¬4k/month. I finally started saving â€” but my health, energy, and freedom were running low.

            In February 2022, war broke out in my homeland. Russia invaded Ukraine. My family was in danger, missiles were flying, and everything I thought mattered suddenly didn't. That moment hit hard â€” I realized that the life I had built wasn't enough. I needed to create <span className="text-red-600 font-bold">real freedom</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            So I went all-in. I started donating to our army and investing â‚¬2,000â€“â‚¬3,000/month into affiliate marketing. At first, I lost money. A lot. I was doing it the "standard" way â€” and failing. So I went dark. <span className="font-bold">Locked in. Spent months testing, studying, building</span>. Sleepless nights, no weekends, just work. Eventually, I <span className="text-red-600 font-bold">cracked the code</span>.
          </p>
          <p>
            Everything changed. Over the next six months, I pulled nearly <span className="text-red-600 font-bold">â‚¬400,000 in net profit</span>. I bought my dream car, traveled across Europe â€” Ibiza, Marbella, Positano, Amsterdam, London, Berlin. I quit both jobs. For the first time ever, I had full control of my time and income.
          </p>
          <p>
            That success led to my agency â€” <span className="font-bold">ADvantage</span> 
            <Link href="https://advantage-agency.co" target="_blank" className="text-blue-500 font-bold"> (here's the link)</Link> â€”
            and now, this course. I'm not here to sell dreams. I'm here to show you the path, and if you're serious, even offer you a seat at the table. My <span className="text-red-600 font-bold">top students now earn up to â‚¬5,000/month</span> working with us. This is just a part of my story. Nothing about it was easy. But if I did it â€” so can you. And I'll show you how.
