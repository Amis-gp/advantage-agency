    "description2": "We identified a target contact base of <strong>5,000 individuals</strong>, formatted it appropriately, and prepared it for upload into Facebook. What did this achieve? Now we can show our ads exclusively to users who have shown some level of interest in accounting; this significantly <strong>narrows down targeting</strong> and filters out most users. Additionally, it allows us to create <strong>lookalike audiences</strong> similar to our target audience."
