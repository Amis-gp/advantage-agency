In the last few months, the results have been very poor, we have changed three specialists, and we could not improve the situation. Of course, I was skeptical about any marketing specialists, but now I realize that nothing can be done without risk and trust. <br/><br/>Now I'm glad that the Advantage team helped me get out of this, pointed out problem areas and generally supported me in various matters, which was very much lacking in my previous experience. At the moment, I am grateful for the work done and hope for further fruitful cooperation!"
