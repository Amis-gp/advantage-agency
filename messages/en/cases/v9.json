    "paragraph1": "Meet Evgenyi - <strong className='text-orange-500'>owner of a residential engineering company in Los Angeles,</strong> more than 5 years on the market. His company offers a wide range of residential engineering services such as: foundation and retaining structure, residential remodels and additions, interior design, patio design and other. Despite the impeccable quality of service, Evgenyi faced the problem of <u>attracting new clients</u> and the company's media exposure on the Internet. The company's growth stagnated and marketing was the weak link in the business.",
    "paragraph2": "Evgenyi had tried many things and was desperate. He realized that if he didn't take drastic action, the company was in danger of shutting down. And then he saw our ad. It didn't take long for Evgenyi to decide to trust us because of <strong>our experience in the residential engineering industry.</strong> Our proven system combines strategies based on in-depth data analysis with an impeccable understanding of the industry. This allows us to deliver impressive results."
