Users get familiar with the mechanics and even receive a bonus before downloading — which massively boosts <strong>click-to-install</strong>.<br><br><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Running traffic through <strong>smartlink+</strong> maximizes user coverage. That's why <strong>iOS traffic ends up cheaper</strong>, and your <strong>ROI increases</strong>.",
