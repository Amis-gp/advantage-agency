    "title": "Cold Emails: Automation and Scaling",
    "description": "Cold emails are automated email campaigns sent to potential clients who are not yet familiar with your business. They are ideal for scaling B2B lead generation but require careful setup.",
    "howItWorks": {
      "title": "How It Works",
      "description": "A campaign typically includes 3–5 emails with intervals. Variables are used for personalization. Information is logically distributed: introduction, value, call to action."
    },
    "advantages": {
      "title": "Advantages of Cold Emails",
      "items": "Scalability: You can send thousands of emails in a short time|Automation: Works with minimal intervention after setup|Measurability: Easy to track opens, clicks, and replies|Effectiveness: Direct contact with decision-makers"
    },
    "disadvantages": {
      "title": "Challenges of Cold Emails",
      "items": "Infrastructure setup: The domain must be properly configured to avoid spam|Deliverability: Spam filters are becoming increasingly strict|Testing time: Tests are needed for high conversion"

    "title": "LinkedIn Outreach: Personalization and Social Interaction",
    "description": "LinkedIn is a platform for professional networking where outreach depends more on manual work and social activity. The emphasis here is on building trust through an individual approach.",
    "howItWorks": {
      "title": "How It Works",
      "description": "You find decision-makers, add them to your network with a personalized invitation, send messages that take their profile into account, and engage in social activity (likes, comments)."
    },
    "advantages": {
      "title": "Advantages of LinkedIn Outreach",
      "items": "Direct contact: Communication in a professional environment|Trust: Social activity creates a positive impression|Flexibility: You can adapt messages to a specific person|Long-term connections: A contact can become valuable in the future"
    },
    "disadvantages": {
      "title": "Challenges of LinkedIn Outreach",
      "items": "Manual work: Personalizing messages and invitations takes a lot of time, limiting scalability|Platform limits: LinkedIn restricts the number of invitations and messages, and violating rules can lead to account blocking|Profile completeness: Your profile must look professional (photo, experience, recommendations), otherwise decision makers won't trust you|Social activity: You need to regularly publish content, comment on posts, or endorse skills to appear as an active network participant"

    "example": {
      "title": "Example:",
      "description": "You find an Operations Manager of a logistics company on LinkedIn, like their post about optimization, add them to contacts with an invitation: 'Your post about logistics inspired me.
