      "title": "What is Lead Scraping and Why is it Challenging?",
      "content": "Lead scraping is the process of automatically collecting contact data (emails, phone numbers, social media profiles) from open sources such as LinkedIn, Google Maps, Instagram, Yelp, corporate websites, and other sources. At first glance, it seems simple: find a website, copy contacts, done. But in practice, it's much more complex:",
      "list": [
        "Manual collection is time-consuming and expensive: Imagine needing to collect 10,000 contacts from LinkedIn. Even with a team, this would take weeks, and mistakes are inevitable.",
        "Diversity of sources: Each channel (Instagram, Google Maps, Yelp) has its own structure, which complicates automation.",
        "Data quality: Many contacts may be outdated, inactive, or irrelevant to your business.",
        "Platform limitations: Most websites and social networks have anti-scraping protection that blocks mass data collection."
      ],
      "conclusion": "That's why many businesses turn to specialized tools and agencies that know how to collect quality data without risks."

      "content": "There are dozens of lead collection services online, but most have serious limitations:",
      "list": [
        "Low accuracy: Many tools don't extract contacts (emails, numbers) or provide irrelevant data.",
        "Errors and failures: Incorrect settings or API limitations force you to restart the process from the beginning.",
        "Poor targeting: Services often don't allow you to precisely define your target audience (for example, \"marketing directors, agro-companies in the US\").",
        "High price: Some solutions are expensive but don't guarantee quality.",
        "Limited sources: Most tools work with one specific platform, ignoring other channels."
      ],
      "conclusion": "At ADvantage, we encountered these problems when looking for an effective solution for ourselves and clients. That's why we developed our own parser that allows flexible work with different sources, precise audience targeting, and clean, up-to-date data. Our Scraping Leads Case shows how we helped a business collect a lead database and process them."

      "title": "For Which Niches Does Lead Scraping Work?",
      "content": "Lead scraping is universal, but its effectiveness depends on the niche and the complexity of data collection. Here are a few examples:\n* Easy niches: E-commerce, local businesses (restaurants, salons), freelancers. Data is often available on Google Maps, Yelp, directories, or Instagram.\n* Medium complexity: Marketing agencies, consultants, B2B services. You need to target decision-makers through LinkedIn or corporate websites.\n* Complex niches: IT, SaaS, fintech. Decision-maker contacts are rarely published openly, so deep analysis and a combination of sources are needed.\nRegardless of the niche, the key to success is a clear understanding of your target audience (ICP). For example, for a SaaS company, we can collect CTO contacts from companies of a certain size, and for Beauty salons - an audience from competitors' Instagram accounts, etc.",
