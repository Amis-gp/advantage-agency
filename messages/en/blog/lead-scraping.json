        "Lead scraping is the process of automatically collecting contact data (emails, phone numbers, social media profiles) from public sources like LinkedIn, Google Maps, Instagram, Yelp, company websites, and more. At first glance, it seems simple: find a site, copy the contacts, done. But in reality, it's much more complicated:",
        [
          "Manual collection is slow and expensive: Imagine you need to collect 10,000 contacts from LinkedIn. Even with a team, it would take weeks, and mistakes are inevitable.",
          "Variety of sources: Each channel (Instagram, Google Maps, Yelp) has its own structure, making automation difficult.",
          "Data quality: Many contacts may be outdated, inactive, or irrelevant to your business.",
          "Platform restrictions: Most sites and social networks have protections against scraping, blocking mass data collection."

        [
          "Low accuracy: Many tools fail to extract contacts (emails, phone numbers) or return irrelevant data.",
          "Errors and failures: Incorrect settings or API limits force you to restart the process from scratch.",
          "Poor targeting: Services often don't let you precisely define your target audience (e.g., 'marketing directors, agro companies in the USA').",
          "High price: Some solutions are expensive but don't guarantee quality.",
          "Limited sources: Most tools work with only one specific platform, ignoring other channels."

That's why we developed our own scraper, which allows flexible work with different sources, precise audience targeting, and clean, up-to-date data. Here's a case showing how we helped a business collect and process a lead database."

        "Lead scraping is universal, but its effectiveness depends on the niche and the complexity of data collection. Here are a few examples:",
        [
          "Easy niches: E-commerce, local businesses (restaurants, salons), freelancers. Data is often available on Google Maps, Yelp, directories, or Instagram.",
          "Medium complexity: Marketing agencies, consultants, B2B services. You need to target decision-makers via LinkedIn or company websites.",
          "Complex niches: IT, SaaS, fintech. Decision-maker contacts are rarely published openly, so you need deep analysis and a combination of sources."
        ],
        "Regardless of the niche, the key to success is a clear understanding of your ideal customer profile (ICP). For example, for B2B companies, lead scraping can target specific decision-makers in organizations by focusing on job titles, company size, and industry, while for retail companies, scraping helps find clients based on their interests."
